ALWAYS FOLLOW THIS VERIFICATION WORKFLOW when adding ANY source code:

1. WRITE CODE FIRST - Create/modify source files
2. ALWAYS WRITE UNIT TESTS for new functionality
3. RUN MANDATORY TESTING PIPELINE:
   - For frontend changes:
       - First run pixi run -e dev test-frontend
       - Second run pixi run -e dev lint-frontend
       - Third run pixi run -e dev type-check-frontend
       - Finally run pixi run -e dev format-frontend
   - For backend changes:
       - First run pixi run -e dev test-backend
       - Second run pixi run -e dev lint-backend
       - Finally run pixi run -e dev format-backend
4. ONLY MARK TASKS COMPLETE after ALL tests pass and linting is clean
5. VERIFY: No failing tests, no linting issues, no type errors before claiming completion
