When adding code to the frontend, you should always write unit tests as well.

You can start the frontend and backend with `pixi run -e dev start-backend` and
`pixi run -e dev start-frontend` respectively.

Then, you should run test to get coverage and failures to fix using
`pixi run -e dev test-frontend`. Once everything works, you should check for linting
issue with `pixi run -e dev lint-frontend`. Then, make sure that the type are correct
with `pixi run -e dev type-check-frontend`. And finally, you can reformat using
`pixi run -e dev format-frontend`.
